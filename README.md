Daily intake scanner

My 70-year-old grandmother, who enjoys both cooking and eating, asked me after reading the news about how to keep track of what she is consuming around the day to make sure she doesnâ€™t eat more than what she needs for her age. She fears that since a few of her friends have been diagnosed with diabetes, mainly due to incorrect diet for their age, in order to not develop diabetes, she is currently trying to be mindful of her daily intake. However, she finds it hard as the information (calorie intake and sugar intake) is proven difficult to comprehend. It is unclear of how much she ate and how that relates to the nutrition she is getting. Therefore, she is seeking a solution. She wants something that is easy to use as well as quick, convenient for her and for the system to store each of the products she ate.
